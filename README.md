## Log

### Day 1 4/19
I spent most of the day trying to figure out how to best turn the generated dungeon into  
a dungeon that was drawn on the map, and had corridors between them. I was having trouple with the corridors being weirdly  
offset from the room.

### Day 2 4/20
added a map data json file for storing width and height information, and spent the rest of class talking about ap exams

### Day 3 4/24
I forgot my computer
