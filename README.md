## Description
A basic roguelike game created for my 10th grade computer science final project. It has some bugs with wall collisions, but other than that it is a fully working roguelike game with the simple win condition of killing all of the enemies in the level.

## Installation
Currently there is only a linux build of the game, which you can download from the releases tab on github

## Building
In order to build the game from source, first clone the git repository and install the 

```
git clone https://github.com/Mythical84/roguelike
cd roguelike
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run the game with:
```
python main.py
```
